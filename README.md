## tims dotfiles ##

just some of my dotfiles. mostly osx and brew oriented but
also for my cs.dartmouth.edu linux

most of my homedir is in dropbox (Documents, Pictures, Desktop) but i don't run dropbox on linux
since my homedir is on nfs and dropbox and nfs don't play nice. granted i could run dropbox on the fileserver, but its not really worth it.
